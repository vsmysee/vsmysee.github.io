---
我们需要学习太多框架，是否应该跳出框架来思考？比如为什么人家能写出这样的框架，他们的理论基础是什么？
理论模型是什么？

回到基础性内功修炼

- The Pragmatic Programmer
- Clean Code
- The Clean Coder
- Domain-Driven Design
- Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests
- Continuous Delivery


所有的项目都是不同的，除非越过表象：
All projects seem different unless you look under the surface:

- Programming languages are different, but design smells are alike.
- Frameworks are different, but the same design patterns shine through.
- Developers are different, but rules of dealing with people are uniform.

技术来来去去，时间太珍贵
Remember – frameworks, libraries and tools come and go. Time is precious.
