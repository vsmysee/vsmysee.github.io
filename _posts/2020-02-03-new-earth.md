从New Earth一书中摘取的一段


```
The greatest achievement of humanity is not its works of art, science, or technology, but the recognition of its own dysfunction, its own madness. In the distant past, this recognition already came to a few individuals. A man called Gautama Siddhartha, who lived 2,600 years ago in India, was perhaps the first who saw it with absolute clarity. Later the title Buddha was conferred upon him. Buddha means “the awakened one.” At abut the same time, another of humanity’s early awakened teachers emerged in China. His name was Lao Tzu. He left a record of his teaching in the form of one of the most profound spiritual books ever written, the Tao Te Ching.

人类最伟大的成就不是它的艺术、科学或技术

而是认识到它自己的功能失调，它自己的疯狂。

在遥远的过去，这种认识已经传到了一些人的耳朵里。一个叫乔达摩·悉达多的人

生活在2600年前的印度，他可能是第一个完全清楚地看到它的人。后来他被授予佛的称号

佛陀的意思是“觉悟者”。

与此同时，另一位人类早期觉醒的老师出现在中国。他的名字叫老子。

他把自己的教导记录在《道德经》中，这是有史以来最深刻的精神著作之一。
